# sidx

Go language, given the attached package, if possible I need a method on `SidxBox` where you give it `ReferencedSize` input, and it adds a `SidxReference` to the slice, and updates any other fields as needed. also if possible I would like to remove RawData from `SidxBox` and do a proper Encode. please make sure the `SidxBox` Parse/Encode is still a proper round trip with the update
